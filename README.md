## **Conclusion and Recommendation**
---
The analysis highlights several findings regarding users' purchasing intetion online. First, it highlights the significant peaks and dips in transaction counts and user sessions within this dataset's period, where we see a very similar but not the same trend. Then, we see a positive correlation between bounce rates and exit rates only between 0% to 20%, which means that all pages were consistent in their performance to keep users from exiting their page. Then, we learned that Product-Related pages are where users will end up on most of the time, which means that these pages are the KEY to conversions. Analysis also shows that non-special days are when people tend to check out online shops the most instead of special days. 

According to the analysis, the following are what I would recommend Offbrand Inc.:
- **Enhancing Product-Related Content**: As product pages are where online users look the most for in an online shop, Offbrand Inc. should look to invest the most time optimizing these pages for their online store. 
- **In Promotions, Timing is Key**: Offbrand Inc. should always be on the look-out for the best time to schedule their promotions. Because as we can see, it does convert to user transaction and user sessions, especially in seasonal sales in the US like Black Friday.
- **Campaigns Should be Done in Low Points**: Why is this? Because dips are where people are least interested, Offbrand Inc. should learn from this dataset and create an effective campaign that sparks new interests when there isn't any, which in the long run will help stabilize revenue gains from even the lowest points of user transaction.
- **Exclusive Deals on Special Days**: People should have a reason to buy during Special Days, so that even during Special Days, users are still interested in visiting their website. This is best done by creating exclusive deals / products during Special Days.
- **Research on Outliers in Bounce Rates and Exit Rates**: By doing this, Offbrand Inc. will have a better understanding why some pages are clicked off more than others and improve based on that information.
